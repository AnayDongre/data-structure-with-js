***************** Time Complexity **********************

O(1) 
    --> Constant time Complexity
    --> No matter the number of inputs time will remain the same

O(n) 
    --> Linear Time Complexity
    --> Time increases linearly as number of inputs increases

Big O Rules
    Rule 1 --> Big O is always for the worst case
    Rule 2 --> Ignore all the constants in Big O equation
    Rule 3 --> Use different terms for inputs
    Rule 4 --> Drop all non-dominant terms. Logically the biggest power of n is the bottleneck for time complexity 


Calculating time complexity of a function by above 4 rules
    --> Find O of each operation
    --> sum it
    --> max power of n is the time complexity of the function
